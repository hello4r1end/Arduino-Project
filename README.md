 In this project i used arduino code,arduino board,breadboard,an ethernet board, wires, resistors 2 leds, a sensor lm335 and DHT11 sensor.
 Arduino code take all the informations from arduino board and send it to html code who i install in sd card. In html code i used Ajax in
 order to all this information to go into a Java coding who i wrote the coding for the smartphone.
	
	Some advices
	
	Check that this ip(192, 168, 1, 177) working in your network
 check the pins of led
